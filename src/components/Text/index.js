              <TextLetter>S</TextLetter>creaming into existence with the birth of the universe, the Void is a manifestation of the unknowable nothingness that lies beyond. 
              It is a force of insatiable hunger, waiting through the eons until its masters, the mysterious Watchers, mark the final time of undoing, and so usher in total oblivion across Runeterra.
              To be a mortal touched by this power is to suffer an agonizing glimpse of eternal unreality, enough to shatter even the strongest mind. Denizens of the Void realm itself are construct-creatures, often of only limited sentience, 
              but tasked with a singular purpose - to usher in total oblivion across Runeterra.

              The symbol for the Void likely references the Yellow Sign, from Robert W. Chambers' anthology The King in Yellow. Chambers associated his Sign & King with Ambrose Bierce's pastoral deity Hastur. H. P. Lovecraft would later incorporate all three into his Cthulhu Mythos.
              Riot's Void symbol strongly resembles Kevin Ross' 1989 Yellow Sign design, as Chambers only mentioned but never described or designed the sign.
              It has been stated that Void portals exist outside of Shurima.

              One of the few known ways to combat the Void is to starve it. With no organic or magical sustenance nearby, the Voidâ€™s material growth will slow, until it eventually falls into a dormant state.
              Cosmic moon energy from the Diana OriginalSquare Moon Aspect is also one of the only things that can subdue Void creatures, being used to fend off Voidborn near the Marai Village.

        <TextLetter>T</TextLetter>he Void is a nightmarish dimension said to exist outside space and time, where terrifying living weapons were wrought to win an ancient and long-since ended war. 
        No-one truly understands how the Void came into existence, but tales of its terrible denizens have wormed their way into the dream consciousness of almost every culture's legends, creation myths, and dark folktales. 
        Those few scattered grimoires and madmen that dare speak of the Void at all speak of it as an infinite realm of unfettered creation, tortured landscapes of crazed organic machinery, magical weapon-looms and mountainous flesh-forges. 
        None have yet ventured into the Void and lived, for mortals would almost certainly be consumed and woven into the endless process of creation.

        In places where the mystical barriers between Runeterra and the Void have been worn thin, the air feels charged, and fantastical occurrences are the norm. 
        Rivers run with vibrant colors, flowers bloom with incredible perfumes, and living beings experience psychedelic visions and surges in magical power. 
        For a time, such places are wondrous and brimming with miracles, but soon the landscape is twisted into new and deadly forms, 
        and if the Void is able to consume enough biomass to survive, it can grow and evolve into something ferocious and terrifying.
